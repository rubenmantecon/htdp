; An Editor is a structure:
;   (make-editor String String)
; interpretation (make-editor s t) describes an editor
; whose visible text is (string-append s t) with 
; the cursor displayed between s and t

;Exercise 83. Design the function render, which consumes an Editor and produces an image.

(define TEXTBOX (empty-scene 200 20))
(define CURSOR (rectangle 1 20 "solid" "red"))

; Editor -> Image
; Takes the values of an Editor and renders them as a textbox
(define (render e)
  (overlay/align "left" "center"
                 (text (string-append (editor-pre e) (editor-post e)) 16 "black")
                 TEXTBOX))
