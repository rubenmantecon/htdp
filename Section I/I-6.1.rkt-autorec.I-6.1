;Exercise 94. Draw some sketches of what the game scenery looks like at various stages. Use the sketches to determine the constant and the variable pieces of the game. For the former, develop physical and graphical constants that describe the dimensions of the world (canvas) and its objects. Also develop some background scenery. Finally, create your initial scene from the constants for the tank, the UFO, and the background.

(define WIDTH 400)
(define HEIGHT 600)
(define BACKGROUND (empty-scene 400 600 "mediumblue"))
(define UFO (overlay/align "center"
                           "top"
             (rectangle 50 10 "solid" "yellow")
             (rectangle 15 5 "solid" "green")))

(define TANK (rectangle 40 14 "solid" "red"))
(define WORLD (place-images
               (list
                UFO
                TANK)
               (list
                (make-posn 0 0)
                (make-posn (/ WIDTH 2) (/ HEIGHT 2)))
               BACKGROUND))
