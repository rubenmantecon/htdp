; Exercise 77. Provide a structure type definition and a data definition for representing points in time since midnight.
; A point in time consists of three numbers: hours, minutes, and seconds.

; A Point in Time (PiT) is a structure:
;  (make-time Number Number Number)
; interpretation (make-time h m s)
(define-struct time [h m s])

; Exercise 78. Provide a structure type and a data definition
; for representing three-letter words. A word consists of lowercase letters,
; represented with the 1Strings "a" through "z" plus #false.
; Note This exercise is a part of the design of a hangman game; see exercise 396.

; A Three-Letter Word (tlw) is a structure:
; (make-tlw 3String #false)
; interperetation (make-tlw "abc" #false)
