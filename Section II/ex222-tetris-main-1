; 
; A Tetris is a structure:
;   (make-tetris Block Landscape)
; (make-tetris b0 (list b1 b2 ...))
; interpretation: b0 is the dropping block, while b1, b2, and ... are resting
;
; A Landscape is one of: 
; – '() 
; – (cons Block Landscape)
; interpretation: the blocks that are already in the scene
;
; A Block is a structure:
;   (make-block N N)
; (make-block x y)
; interpretation: depicts a block whose left corner is (* x SIZE) pixels from the left and (* y SIZE) pixels from the top
